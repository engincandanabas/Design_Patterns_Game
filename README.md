## The Singleton Pattern
We can summarize Singleton in the following two items.

     - It guarantees that a class will have an instance.
     - Makes this class a global access point.
     
The Singleton design pattern ensures that there is only one object at a time (and that object is the one that comes with us as we switch scenes).
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in C#. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
